## 2024-05-22 - [LID Reverse Mapping Cache]
**Learning:** `readLidReverseMapping` in `src/utils.ts` synchronously reads files from disk (`fs.readFileSync`) inside a loop over multiple potential directories for every single LID lookup.
**Action:** Implement an in-memory cache (Map) for LID-to-E164 mappings to avoid repeated disk I/O. This is a classic "expensive operation in a hot path" (or at least a repeated path). The cache should probably have a small size limit or TTL to avoid stale data if mappings change (though mappings are likely stable). A simple `Map<string, string | null>` with a reasonable max size (e.g. 1000 entries) would work. Since the files are written once and rarely change (pairing happens once), caching "not found" (null) is also important to prevent repeated scanning for non-existent mappings.
